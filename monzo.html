                <h3 class="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="introduction">Monzo is a digital bank account that allows you to track your spending and send payments easily. They also have a good allowance interest free for spending abroad. </p>
        <h3 class="problem">Problem</h3>
        <p>The Monzo app has many flawed design choices. 

            It’s difficult to navigate through pages to get what you want. 
            When adding scheduled payments from a pot, there are two ways of doing this: 
            <li>Monzo products</li>
            <li>Direct Debit and Standing Orders</li>
            
            There is lots of vertical scrolling to get to your pots. 
            
            According to my research, users found that the Trends page is very confusing and complicated and as a result many do not use them.
            
            The Payments page has ‘Favourites’ and ‘Recents’ at the bottom of the page. It would be more beneficial to have them at the top for easy access.</p>
        <h3 class="goal">Goal</h3>
        <p>The goal is to redesign the app to allow the user to navigate through it seamlessly and intuitively.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        
            <h3 class="solution">Research</h3>
        
        <p>Monzo has 14% of the adult population in the UK using their app. Monzo’s top competitor is Starling which has half the number of users. Since this is a personal project, I did some research on my ideas to see if my assumptions made sense. I created a google form for users to fill out:
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S4y3buvDqVtkXyBd-m9X01HxHFF1j4hz0__67cc0Jh4/edit" target="_blank">Monzo Research - Google Forms</a>
        </p>
        <p>The summary is that most users: 

            <li>Do not use Monzo as a main bank account</li>
            <li>Use Monzo because of how easy it is to send money to friends and the perks of using it abroad</li>
            <li>Do not use the trends page</li>
            <li>Don’t find it hard to navigate through the app</li>
            <li>Use the app every day</li>
            <li>Use the payments and pots page</li>
        </p>
        <h3 class="early-ideation">Early Ideation</h3>
        <p>Initially, I looked at the information architecture of the entire application and the main flows surrounding it. </p>

        <div class="caption">Current Information Architecture</div>
        <br>
        <p>After some thought I tried to redesign the architecture so it was more flat than vertical.</p>

        <p>This along with the <a href="">research</a> allowed me to figure out what users wanted.</p>
