                Monzo is a digital bank account that allows you to track your
                spending and send payments easily. They also have a good
                allowance interest free for spending abroad.

            <div class="problem">
              <h3 class="problem">Problem</h3>
              <p>
                The Monzo app has many flawed design choices. It’s difficult to
                navigate through pages to get what you want. When adding
                scheduled payments from a pot, there are two ways of doing this:
                <li>Monzo products</li>
                <li>Direct Debit and Standing Orders</li>
                There is lots of vertical scrolling to get to your pots.
                According to my research, users found that the Trends page is
                very confusing and complicated and as a result many do not use
                them. The Payments page has ‘Favourites’ and ‘Recents’ at the
                bottom of the page. It would be more beneficial to have them at
                the top for easy access.

            The goal is to redesign the app to allow the user to navigate
            through it seamlessly and intuitively.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="research">
          <h3 class="research">Research</h3>
          <p>
            Monzo has 14% of the adult population in the UK using their app.
            Monzo’s top competitor is Starling which has half the number of
            users. Since this is a personal project, I did some research on my
            ideas to see if my assumptions made sense. I created a google form
            for users to fill out:
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1S4y3buvDqVtkXyBd-m9X01HxHFF1j4hz0__67cc0Jh4/edit"
              target="_blank"
              >Monzo Research - Google Forms</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The summary is that most users:
            <li>Do not use Monzo as a main bank account</li>
            <li>
              Use Monzo because of how easy it is to send money to friends and
              the perks of using it abroad
            </li>
            <li>Do not use the trends page</li>
            <li>Don’t find it hard to navigate through the app</li>
            <li>Use the app every day</li>
            <li>Use the payments and pots page</li>
          </p>

            Initially, I looked at the information architecture of the entire
            application and the main flows surrounding it.

          <div class="caption">Current Information Architecture</div>
          <br />
          <p>
            After some thought I tried to redesign the architecture so it was
            more flat than vertical.

            This along with the research allowed me to figure out what users
            wanted.
