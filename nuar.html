            <p class="introduction">
              NUAR is a web application that allows users to view assets such as
              fiber optic lines, gas lines, water lines, etc. underground. This
              is so that when construction workers dig underground, they don’t
              dig into one of these lines, cutting it and potentially
              disruptions many homes.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are two sides to NUAR. The Web Portal, which contains the
              user interface for the map and it’s assets, and the Admin Portal
              which contains the functionality for being able to manage
              everything. I worked on the Admin Portal in this project.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="problem">
            <h3 class="problem">Problem</h3>
            <p>
              There was no user interface for creating contracts between
              organisations. A contract is an agreement for work between two
              organisations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previously, you couldn’t create any contracts. There was no UI UX
              team for the Admin Portal since it was a very small part of the
              overall project, therefore I was given the freedom to design this
              page independently. The only constraint was to adhere to the
              Government Design Service (GDS) styling.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="goal">
            <h3 class="goal">Goal</h3>
            <p>
              Create a page which allows the admins of organisation to create
              contracts with other organisations so that they could expand their
              work.
            </p>
          </div>
          <impact>
            <h3 class="impact">Impact</h3>
            <p>
              The impact of this work meant that there was increased visibility
              of areas in the UK, which allowed a more comprehensive overview of
              how assets are distributed underground. The more contracts formed,
              the more information the map receives, and the more detailed our
              view becomes.
            </p>
          </impact>
          <div class="user-personas">
            <h3 class="user-personas">User Personas</h3>
            <p>
              There are two personas. We have the Super User, and we have the
              Admin.
            </p>
            <li>
              Super User - These are the developers from Atkins Realis, who
              control the entire system. They have permissions to do everything
            </li>
            <li>
              Admins - These are the users of the organisation who have been
              nominated to be Admins. They have permissions to only do certain
              things, listed in the Early Ideation section.
            </li>
          </div>

          <div class="early-ideation">
            <h3 class="early-ideation">Early Ideation</h3>
            <p>
              To start to understand the problem, I created a diagram that
              outlines how contracts can be formed and relationships between
              different organisation types.
            </p>
            <p>There are 3 oragnisation types:</p>
            <li>Asset Owner (AO)</li>
            <li>Tier 1 Organisation (T1O)</li>
            <li>Tier 2 Organisation (T2O)</li>
            <div class="supply-chain-overview-image"></div>
            <p>
              Then I started to figure out what functionality is needed in order
              to bring this to life, so I drafted some acceptance criteria:
            </p>
            <div class="acceptance-criteria-image"></div>
            <p>After this I created some user stories:</p>
            <div class="user-stories-image"></div>
            <p>
              I then began prototyping ideas on Figma. You can take a look
              <a
                href="https://www.figma.com/design/oXn1BJNEQ7MP9lGegjkUyR/Contracts?node-id=0-1&t=4NuNyLyeAWhU8dJu-0"
                >here</a
              >
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="testing">
            <h3 class="testing">Testing</h3>
            <p>
              This was handed-off to user research where they did some usability
              testing with users and brought some feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the pieces of feedback were that users found that their
              organisation type was irrelevant information and it takes up a
              large portion of space in the view. The other was that contract
              was a confusing term, so we replaced it with ‘Supply Chain’.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to this, the
              <a
                href="https://www.figma.com/design/oXn1BJNEQ7MP9lGegjkUyR/Contracts?node-id=226-7811&t=4NuNyLyeAWhU8dJu-4"

                >Create Contract</a
              >
              page had a problem. A user could type their organisation in
              slightly differently or with capital letters and create duplicate
              accounts. This was resolved by having a drop down list so that
              users could select their organisation (see below). This required
              them to be onboarded and invited first.

              Upon onboarding more users, we found that the dropdown lists when
              creating organisations were incredibly large and required a lot of
              scrolling to find your organisation. An idea I had to make them
              more scrollable was to somehow implement search functionality.
            </p>
            <p>This could be done with:</p>
            <li>
              A table view listing all the organisations like how it’s done in
              the manage contracts page
            </li>
            <li>A searchable drop down list</li>
            <p>
              The former would be slow and clunky whereas the latter as it would
              be more intuitive from a user’s point of view.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second approach was harder since GDS does not include any code
              for making a drop down list searchable so I had to improvise with
              coding this. The design is shown below:
            </p>
            <br />
            <div class="search-supply-chain-image"></div>
          </div>
